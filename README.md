# set-proxy-for-ubuntu-server
Shell script for configuring proxy for ubuntu server linux. Because some applications read proxy setting from their configuration file, not from global variables.

# Usage
```sh
sudo set_proxy.sh
```

# About
I wrote this script to fix annoyance of setting proxy configuration every time I deployed a new Ubuntu Linux server behind a proxy.
The types of configuration supported depends on my need of course.
So feel free to copy/fork/modify it however you need or like.

If you plan to use this script, it probably means you're behind some sort of proxy and probably can't reach github to get it, chicken and egg problem. :-)
So again feel free to copy/distribute it however you need or like.
